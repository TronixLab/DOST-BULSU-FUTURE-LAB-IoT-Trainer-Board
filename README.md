# DOST-BULSU FUTURE-LAB IoT Trainer Board
## Project Description
FUTURE-LAB (Fault-Tolerant and User-Friendly Trainer Board for Upcoming Research and Engineering Education Lab Kit Integrating Emerging Technologies) is a DOST CRADLE funded research and development project. It is an integrated electronics laboratory trainer board engineered for both academic training and professional development. This board simulates a wide range of hands-on learning, prototype development, and experimentation with emerging technologies in engineering education and research, incorporating critical fault-tolerance mechanisms. It is ideal for learning how to design resilient and reliable smart systems.

Its primary purpose is to:
* Serve as a modular, fault-tolerant platform for exploring embedded systems, IoT, AI, and smart technologies.
* Equip students, educators, and researchers with a user-friendly training environment for real-world applications and interdisciplinary learning.
* Provide a versatile and scalable system that supports classroom instruction, capstone projects, R&D, and technology deployment.
* Demonstrate innovation in areas such as smart agriculture, smart cities, environmental sensing, wireless communication, and edge computing.

### Board Components
FUTURE-LAB is built around the LILYGO TTGO LoRa32, a compact yet powerful development board based on the ESP32 microcontroller, which integrates key wireless communication features and embedded peripherals for rapid Internet of Things (IoT) prototyping and education.
